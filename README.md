**Murma** is a C-based project designed to analyze a person's voice and estimate a wide range of biometric and health-related attributes. Using advanced signal processing and machine learning techniques, **Murma** transforms vocal data into insightful predictions about the speaker's physical characteristics, emotional state, and potential medical conditions.

> [!NOTE]
> The predictions made by Murma are probabilistic and not 100% accurate ‚Äî as reflected in the performance metrics ‚Äî but they provide useful approximations for analysis and exploration.

## `üß†` What Murma Can Estimate From Your Voice:

| Attribute                        | Main Method                                                  | Performance                                    |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Height**                       | Formant analysis ‚Üí estimate vocal-tract length (VTL) + linear regression | r = 0.756 (R¬≤ = 0.572)             |
| **Weight / BMI**                 | MFCC features + balanced random forests                      | AUC up to 0.994 (women 41‚Äì60 yrs)              |
| **Age**                          | X-vectors + QuartzNet (multi-task age/gender)                | MAE 5.12 yrs (M) / 5.29 yrs (F); 99.6% gender  |
| **Gender**                       | Same as above (age/gender multitask)                         | Accuracy 99.6%                                 |
| **Coronary artery disease risk** | CNN + voice biomarkers                                       | 2.6√ó higher hazard of major cardiac events     |
| **Heart-failure mortality**      | Logistic regression + voice biomarkers                       | p < 0.001 (5-year mortality prediction)        |
| **Major depression (MDD)**       | MFCC + i-vectors                                             | AUC gain +14% over baseline                    |
| **Parkinson‚Äôs disease**          | CNN (InceptionV3 on spectrograms)                            | AUC 0.9125; accuracy 91.1%                     |
| **Emotion / Stress**             | GRU + MFCC (IEMOCAP dataset)                                 | Accuracy 97.47%                                |

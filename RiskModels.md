# üí° Health Risk Estimations Based on Voice Analysis (Without AI and high technology, just with calculations)

This document summarizes the recommended **weights and thresholds** for estimating various health conditions using voice features. These formulas are simplified approximations, based on research findings, and intended for use in C-based signal processing systems.

## ü´Ä Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)

**Relevant voice factors:**

| Factor      | Type     | Weight    | Explanation                                     |
|-------------|----------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `age`       | Years    | `+0.2f`   | Risk increases after 45 (men), 55 (women)       |
| `gender`    | Boolean  | `+0.2f`   | Slightly higher risk for women                  |
| `intensity` | dB       | `-0.1f`   | Low voice intensity may indicate poor health    |
| `jitter`    | Percent  | `+0.3f`   | Irregular pitch patterns                        |
| `shimmer`   | Percent  | `+0.2f`   | Amplitude instability linked to stress/fatigue  |

**High-risk threshold:** `> 5.0`

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** All calculations are additive and cumulative, and final scores can be normalized to a 0‚Äì10 scale if needed. These weights are based on general patterns in medical literature and should be further calibrated with real-world data where possible.
